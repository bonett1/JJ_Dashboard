# Johnson & Johnson Dashboard  
Data visualization project created for an online challenge by Johnson & Johnson, aiming to present an analysis of healthcare services in Brazil.  

## Description  
This dashboard was built as part of an online challenge, serving as an MVP created within one week. It was inspired by a J&J initiative that focuses on investing in healthcare workers across Latin America, enhancing their skills, and ensuring higher-quality healthcare services for patients.
